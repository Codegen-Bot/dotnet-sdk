  All community bots have an ID which starts with `bot://hub/`. Here are some examples of bot IDs being used:
  
  ```
  # To use a bot to generate code:
  bot install bot://hub/dotnet/botfactory
  # When building a custom bot, add a dependency on another bot:
  bot add bot://hub/statesmith
  ```
  
  Tips for choosing a bot ID:
  
  - If the bot generates source code in a specific language or VM, it should have that in the URL.
    E.g. the `/dotnet/` in the bot ID `bot://hub/dotnet/botfactory` implies the bot generates code
    relevant only to the Microsoft .NET platform.
  - Some bots generate code in multiple languages; these shouldn't have a specific language or VM
    in their ID.
  - Choose a bot ID that starts with bot://hub/. Other bot ID prefixes, like bot://core/,
    are reserved for future Codegen Bot releases.
  - Bot IDs are usually lower case
  - If the bot is for generated a specific file name or file extension, that can be included in the bot ID.
