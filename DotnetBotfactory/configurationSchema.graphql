    All bots have an ID. They all start with `bot://`. Here are some examples of bot IDs being used:
    
    # To use a bot to generate code:
    bot install bot://hub/dotnet/botfactory
    # When building a custom bot, add a dependency on another bot:
    bot add bot://hub/statesmith
    
    Generally if the bot generates source code in a specific language,
    then the bot ID should be grouped using the language name (e.g. the `/dotnet/` above)
    but if the bot generates code in multiple languages or is language agnostic,
    it's fine to leave that out.
