    All community bots have an ID which starts with `bot://hub/`. Here are some examples of bot IDs being used:
    
    ```
    # To use a bot to generate code:
    bot install bot://hub/dotnet/botfactory
    # When building a custom bot, add a dependency on another bot:
    bot add bot://hub/statesmith
    ```
    
    Tips for choosing a bot ID:
    
    - If the bot generates source code in a specific language or VM, it should have that in the URL.
      E.g. the `/dotnet/` in the bot ID `bot://hub/dotnet/botfactory` implies the bot generates code
      relevant only to the Microsoft .NET platform.
    - Some bots generate code in multiple languages; these shouldn't have a specific language or VM
      in their ID.
    - Choose a bot ID that starts with bot://hub/. Other bot ID prefixes, like bot://core/,
      are reserved for future Codegen Bot releases.
