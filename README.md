# CodegenBot .NET SDK

This is the .NET SDK for building bots with [CodegenBot](https://www.codegen.bot/).

This repo includes [a NuGet package which can be used in .NET bots to easily interact with CodegenBot](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CodegenBot).

This repo includes [a Docker container which can be used to build dotnet-based bots](https://hub.docker.com/r/codegenbot/dotnet-bot-builder). This is useful because installing the requirements to build a .NET-based bot can be tricky, especially when you have .NET preview SDKs installed.

This repo includes the bot `bot://hub/metabot/dotnet`, used to create new bots that are written in C#.
